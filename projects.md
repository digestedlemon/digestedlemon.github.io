## Current Projects

### BonsAPPs AIMDDE

The Glasgow Intelligent Computing Lab (gicLAB) is undertaking the AIMDDE (AI-based Manufacturing Defect Detection at the Edge) research challenge (initially for two months but potentially extended to five), as part of the BonsAPPs EUâ€™s Horizon 2020 project (https://bonsapps.eu/). The overall goal of the challenge is to produce AI models which can effectively detect defects in manufactured goods (e.g., rolled steel, or textiles), and deploy them in a constrained edge device (e.g., Nvidia AGX Xavier), such that their latency/performance would be viable in a real production environment.  Please see our blogpost, and <https://bonsapps.eu/> for details.
